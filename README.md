# WealthMan
This is a desktop application for financial planning.

## Features
Users can enter basic personal information, income sources, expenses, and basic asset information.
Certain assumptions such as inflation rate, and asset rate of return can be entered by
the user.

From that information, projections (forecasts) will be made for several years in the 
future showing how income, assets, and expenses affect a person's net worth.


FYI.   This project is still under HEAVY development and is not ready for use by end users.  
Developers and early adopters can use the program, but should be suspicious of any generated output.
