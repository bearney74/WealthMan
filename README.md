# WealthMan
This is a desktop application for financial planning.

## Features
Users can enter basic personal information, income sources, expenses, and basic asset information.
Certain assumptions such as inflation rate, and asset rate of return can be entered by
the user.

From that information, projections (forecasts) can be made for several years in the 
future showing how income, assets, and expenses affect a person's net worth.

Currently, users can output the projection data in csv format, that can be imported into a spreadsheet
application (Excel, Libre Calc) for further analysis.

Charts can be generated for each projection variable, as well as custom charts for asset totals, asset contri

## Future Plans / Development
I plan on using historic market returns, as well as Monte Carlo simulations to calculate risk.



FYI.   This project is still under HEAVY development and is not ready for use by end users.  
Developers and early adopters can use the program, but should be suspicious of any generated output.
I am interested in feedback.  Please submit any issues/bugs, feature requests to the issues tab above.
